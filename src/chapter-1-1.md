Supply chain management is a complex process that involves the planning, execution, and control of the flow of goods and services from suppliers to customers. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain management has become increasingly important for organizations looking to optimize their operations. In this chapter, we will explore the need for AI-based supply chain management.

Challenges in Supply Chain Management
-------------------------------------

The modern business environment is characterized by rapidly changing customer demands, increased competition, and global supply chains. To remain competitive, organizations need to optimize their supply chain operations and achieve greater efficiency and profitability. However, traditional approaches to supply chain management may not be able to respond quickly to changes in demand or other factors, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs.

Benefits of AI-Based Supply Chain Management
--------------------------------------------

AI-based supply chain management can provide significant benefits for organizations, including:

* Real-time data insights: AI-based tools and processes provide real-time data insights that enable organizations to optimize their supply chain operations more effectively.
* Predictive analytics: By using predictive analytics, organizations can anticipate changes in demand and adjust their operations accordingly, reducing waste and increasing efficiency.
* Automation: The use of AI-based automation can reduce human error and improve efficiency in supply chain operations.
* Collaboration: AI-based supply chain management allows for greater collaboration among partners, improving the flow of goods and services throughout the supply chain.

Conclusion
