To successfully implement AI-based supply chain management, organizations must educate their employees on how to use the new tools and processes effectively. Additionally, organizations must engage employees in the implementation process and address any concerns or challenges that arise.

Business Models and Cost-Effectiveness
--------------------------------------

Implementing AI-based supply chain management can be expensive, requiring significant investment in hardware, software, and personnel. Organizations must carefully consider the cost-effectiveness of implementing these systems and determine the impact on their business models.

Conclusion
