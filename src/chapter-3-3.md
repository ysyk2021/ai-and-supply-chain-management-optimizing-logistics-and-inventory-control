Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way organizations manage their supply chains. In this chapter, we will explore some case studies on the use of AI in supply chain management across different industries.

Walmart
-------

Walmart is using AI-based supply chain management to optimize inventory levels and reduce waste. The company uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from sales transactions, weather forecasts, and other sources to predict demand for products. By using predictive analytics, Walmart is able to adjust inventory levels in real-time, reducing waste and ensuring that products are available when customers want them.

Maersk
------

Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, is using blockchain technology to improve transparency and traceability in its supply chain operations. The company uses a distributed ledger system to record every transaction and shipment, creating an immutable record of each item's journey through the supply chain. This ensures that all parties have access to the same information and can track shipments more accurately.

Coca-Cola
---------

Coca-Cola is using AI-based supply chain management to optimize transportation routes and reduce costs. The company uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from shipping schedules, traffic patterns, and other sources to identify the most efficient routes for transporting goods. By using real-time data and predictive analytics, Coca-Cola is able to adjust transportation routes in real-time, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Amazon
------

Amazon is using robotics and automation to optimize its warehouse operations. The company uses robots to move and sort products, reducing the need for human labor. Additionally, Amazon is using machine learning algorithms to optimize its delivery routes, reducing delivery times and improving customer satisfaction.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, AI-based supply chain management is transforming the way organizations manage their supply chains.
